## Abstract
An adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode controller is proposed to regulate cutting forces during laminectomy under variable patient anatomy. The scheme estimates disturbance bounds online and reconfigures control gains to suppress chatter while ensuring tracking accuracy. Experiments on spine phantoms confirm improved smoothness and safety relative to fixed-gain controllers.
