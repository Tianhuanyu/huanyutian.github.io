## Abstract
We develop a shared-control architecture for robot-assisted osteotomy that integrates patient-specific planning, constraint synthesis, and real-time admittance modulation. The system adapts virtual fixtures to surgical intent and anatomy while compensating for tool-tissue interaction forces. Bench and cadaveric studies show that the framework reduces deviation from surgical plans and lowers exerted forces compared with manual guidance.
