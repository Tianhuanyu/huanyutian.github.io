## Abstract
We present an optimal control formulation for laparoscopic trocar docking that leverages stereo visual tracking and contact force sensing. The method plans collision-aware insertion trajectories while regulating contact forces through model predictive control. Hardware experiments on abdominal phantoms show repeatable, low-force docking without manual intervention.
