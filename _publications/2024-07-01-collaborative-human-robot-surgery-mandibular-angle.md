## Abstract
We report a collaborative surgical workflow for mandibular angle split osteotomy that couples optical tracking with robot-assisted execution. The system reconstructs patient-specific anatomy, generates motion constraints, and modulates haptic feedback to maintain surgeon oversight. Cadaveric studies highlight improvements in osteotomy accuracy and reductions in operative time compared with manual approaches.
