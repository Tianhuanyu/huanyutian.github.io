## Abstract
We present a shared-control policy for steady-hand micromanipulation that explicitly propagates perception uncertainty through motion planning and haptic rendering. A Bayesian pose estimator fuses multi-view microscopy cues, while a risk-aware optimizer modulates virtual fixtures in response to confidence levels. Simulation and benchtop experiments on cell-scale manipulation tasks demonstrate improved success rates and safer force profiles compared with deterministic baselines.
