## Abstract
The paper details the kinematic modeling, workspace analysis, and prototype realization of a reconfigurable cable-driven robot tailored to neurosurgical positioning. By actuating cable anchor geometry, the system maintains dexterity within narrow operative corridors while supporting heavy instrumentation. Simulation and benchtop validation confirm accurate pose control across multiple clinical target locations.
