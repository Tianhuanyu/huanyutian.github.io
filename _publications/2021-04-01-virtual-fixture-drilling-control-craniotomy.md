## Abstract
We propose a learning-from-demonstration workflow that extracts directional admittance profiles and geometric constraints from expert craniotomy demonstrations. The resulting virtual fixtures guide a cooperative robot during skull drilling, balancing accuracy with tactile feedback. Experiments on phantom skulls show reductions in cortical breach risk and tool vibration relative to manual execution.
