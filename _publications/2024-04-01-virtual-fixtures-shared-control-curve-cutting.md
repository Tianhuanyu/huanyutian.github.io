## Abstract
This work proposes a shared-control strategy that enforces virtual fixtures along complex osteotomy curves while preserving surgeon haptic authority. By modeling reciprocating saw dynamics and coupling them with adaptive motion constraints, the approach achieves smoother cuts with lower positioning error than conventional teleoperation. The framework is validated on cadaveric experiments, highlighting improvements in accuracy, workload, and procedural safety.
