## Abstract
This work details the mechanical design, control architecture, and vision-guided manipulation strategies of a remotely operated robot for reactor detector removal. The system integrates force sensing, compliant control, and collision monitoring to mitigate brittle fracture risks in confined nuclear environments. Field tests in a mock-up reactor demonstrate reliable removal with reduced operator workload.
