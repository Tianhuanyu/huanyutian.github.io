## Abstract
This paper introduces a trajectory optimization pipeline that shapes virtual constraints to maximize dynamic excitation during hands-on robot identification. The method enforces safety-aware contact constraints, accounts for self-collision, and exploits model sparsity to reduce experiment duration. Evaluations on a laparoscopic robotic platform show improved parameter observability and lower user effort compared with heuristic excitation maneuvers.
