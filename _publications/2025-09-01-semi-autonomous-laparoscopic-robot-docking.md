## Abstract
We introduce a semi-autonomous docking framework that blends learned vision-based hand–eye estimation with model predictive shared control for trocar alignment in laparoscopic surgery. The method combines multi-modal sensing, uncertainty-aware fusion, and task-constrained motion planning to achieve sub-millimetre alignment repeatability while shortening operative preparation time. Experiments on a clinical laparoscopic platform demonstrate robust convergence under challenging viewpoints and tissue interactions.
