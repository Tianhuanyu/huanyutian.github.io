## Abstract
Respiratory motion-induced vertebral movements can compromise intraoperative accuracy and safety. We present a few-shot learning framework that couples an LSTM autoencoder with an attention mechanism to predict vertebral motion in real time. Dimension reduction tailored to spine kinematics and rapid online adaptation yield prediction errors below 0.15 mm across axes, supporting precise robot-assisted spine interventions.
