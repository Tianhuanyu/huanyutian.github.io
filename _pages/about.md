Huanyu Tian is a postdoctoral research associate in Surgical & Interventional Engineering at King's College London and a recent Ph.D. graduate in Medical Robotics from Beijing Institute of Technology. His work sits at the intersection of shared autonomy, human–robot collaboration, and perception-driven control for surgical and interventional applications. Tian develops embodied robotic agents that blend learning-based perception with physics-informed planning to deliver safe, precise assistance in contact-rich clinical settings.

Current projects explore uncertainty-aware shared control for microscale manipulation, semi-autonomous laparoscopic docking, and collaborative osteotomy workflows. He frequently collaborates with clinical partners to translate algorithms into workflow-aware systems that respect surgeon intent while improving accuracy and reducing setup time. His research has been recognized through awards such as the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award from Beijing Institute of Technology and a Best Student Paper Award at IEEE CYBER.
